I worked in This area for my project:
Social Media Analytics for Business Strategy
Using social media data, create a tool that can discover trends and insights into brand percep-tion, customer sentiment, and market trends. The discovered insights will be helpful for the
organization to align business strategy with data-driven feedback.
